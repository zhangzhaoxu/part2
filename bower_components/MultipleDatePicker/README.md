#What's new ?
###Version 1.2.0
From a good idea of [Asopus](https://github.com/Asopus) I added a new property : **highlight-days** so **days-off** becomes deprecated.

As usual, check the demo page [http://arca-computing.github.io/MultipleDatePicker/](http://arca-computing.github.io/MultipleDatePicker/)
###Version 1.1.6
Fixed an unselection problem

###Version 1.1.X
Some bugs fix and improvements, check demo

###Version 1.1.0
[Soyuka](https://github.com/soyuka) improved the library, you now have events in your callback, so you can play with it. He also add a new callback when you over a day. Check out the demo page !

The parameter "callback" has been deprecated, it's still working but will be removed in a next version, please update.

#What is MultipleDatePicker ?
MultipleDatePicker is an Angular directive to show a simple calendar allowing user to select multiple dates, a callback is called, you can specify some off days or already selected days.

#Install and demo

#What's next ?
We created this directive to have a simple calendar with multi-dates selection. We will keep it simple but any improvement is welcome.
